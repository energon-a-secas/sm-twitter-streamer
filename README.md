I actually hate using Twitter but it has some useful accounts that provide content worth of posting on our favorites chats. With this repository you can send all new tweets from an specified account to Slack and Discord.

Useful accounts worth mentioning:

- [@DescuentosRata](https://twitter.com/DescuentosRata): tweets about offers and discounts, usually only from stores on Chile.
- [@SismoMundial](https://twitter.com/SismoMundial): tweets from any type of disaster around the world. In our country are mostly earthquakes rather than anything.
- [@metrodesantiago](https://twitter.com/metrodesantiago): tweets goes from daily messages to relevant alerts with the subway system (Metro).
- [@TCC_oficial_](https://twitter.com/TCC_oficial_): Transport Community Chile, alerts from Santiago (Santiago is Chile).

In any case if I were you, I'll rather not use more than 2 accounts at the same time (using multi-threads), there are a lot of limits while using the streaming API.

Configuration
---

If you don't have a developer account on Twitter you will need to apply for one. It shouldn't take more than 5 work days to get it approved. 

Once you are done with that, just need to set the corresponding environment variables that eventually i'll add to this README.
